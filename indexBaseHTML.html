      <p>
        Questioning my credentials? Don't just take my word for it! Here are some quotes from a number of my satisfied players:
      </p>

      <!-- Use Nth of type CSS here to style these identicly?-->
      <dev> <!-- Quote 1 -->
        <p>“Ate all the pizza and literally roasted Josh so hard he turned to ash. Still way less toxic the my last GM.”</p>
        <p>Larry the Beleaguered Gamer</p>
      </dev>
      <dev> <!-- Quote 2 -->
        <p>“When I interrupted the game by choking on a mouthful of homemade pretzels, soft but still a bit firm and seasoned 
          just right, Xar was really understanding and when out of his way to solve the problem immediately he was even nice 
          enough not to drop the bill on me. Now I don’t have to worry about lack of air or not having enough energy after work 
          to play! Sure the dying part was kinda uncomfortable but his homemade snacks are worth let me tell you!”</p>
        <p>Hank the Spectral Apprentice Blacksmith</p>
      </dev>
      <dev> <!-- Quote 3 -->
        <p>“When the Dragon pulled the top off my tower, incinerated my 3rd cousin twice removed, and flew off with me in his 
          claws I was expecting to spend another mind numbing couple of months in some musty old tower or dank cave being 
          pestered incessantly until rescue came. Instead the next 2 years were the best of my life, I got to go on a grand 
          adventure the likes of which I’d never really known, and discovered what is how my favourite hobby. 10/10, Would 
          definitely be abducted by this one again!”</p>
        <p>Princess Casandra of Astora</p>
      </dev>
      <dev> <!-- Quote 4 -->
        <p>“I don’t know what happened. One moment I’m marching into the Dragon’s lair to fell the monster, then next thing I 
          know I’m doing freelance adventure work to pay for Magic School student loans and arguing with the Princess about 
          whether or not we should just bust into the Dark Tower of Kul-Va-Tath or sneak in by pretending to be from the Fell 
          Army’s auditing department. It’s not that I didn’t enjoy myself, I really did, I’m just still very confused as to how 
          we got from point A to point D.”</p>
        <p>Ser Alexis, Knight of Astora</p>
      </dev>
      <dev> <!-- Quote 5 -->
        <p>“When our group asked if we could try a system that was hands on he was kind enough to fly us all out to a very nice 
          village a ways off and convinced everyone there to LARP with us. Sure there was a lot of screaming for a bit and lots 
          of quests to put the town hall out but I’m pretty sure everyone had fun!”</p>
        <p>Ron the Peasant</p>
      </dev>
      <dev> <!-- Quote 6 -->
        <p>“He ‘borrowed’ my DAT tape collection and still hasn’t given them back. Are you even proofreading these!?”</p>
        <p>Kal-Thule the Litch</p>
